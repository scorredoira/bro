// The page's own account of itself: what it logged, what it threw, and what it asked for and
// did not get. It lives in the PAGE rather than in a CDP listener because bro is a CLI — every
// command is a process that connects, acts and exits, so nothing here outlives a command. A
// listener would only ever hear what happened while that one command was running.
//
// Three things are captured, and the two that were missing are the ones that matter:
//
//   - console.log/warn/error/info — what was already there.
//   - UNCAUGHT exceptions, via onerror and unhandledrejection. A screen that throws while
//     loading paints half of itself and looks like a design problem.
//   - Requests that FAILED, by wrapping fetch and XHR. A 404 on a data call leaves a screen
//     that renders perfectly and is empty, which a screenshot cannot tell from "no rows yet".
//
// Both of those are invisible to a console patch, and both are how a screen that looks right
// turns out to be broken. `bro network` cannot answer it either: it reads
// performance.getEntriesByType("resource"), which lists what was requested and not how it went.
//
// It is idempotent and cheap, so every command that touches a page installs it without asking.
//
// Kept as a BODY because the two doors take different shapes: Eval is handed a function and
// calls it, while a script registered for new documents is evaluated as source — an arrow
// function there is created and thrown away, which installs nothing at all and looks exactly
// like success. Building both forms from one body is what stops them drifting apart.

// installCapture puts the capture in place for this page, both ways it can be needed.
//
// EvalOnNewDocument is what makes it worth anything: it runs BEFORE the page's own scripts, so
// a throw at load time or a data call that 404s on the first render is caught. It applies to the
// NEXT document, which is why every command that navigates installs before navigating.
//
// The plain Eval covers the page that is already open — `bro console` on a screen loaded ten
// minutes ago still gets whatever happens from now on, rather than nothing.
//
// What it does not cover is the very first page `bro open` loads: Chrome is launched pointing at
// the url, so it is already loading before any session exists to register anything. A `bro
// reload` afterwards gets it. Fixing that means launching blank and navigating, which is a
// change to how Chrome starts for a payoff that a reload already buys.
//
// Failures are deliberately not fatal: capture is an aid, and a command that navigated fine
// should not report failure because instrumenting it did not. The reason still surfaces — it is
// the caller's own action that fails visibly if the page is unusable.
